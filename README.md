# Physical Computing Semester Project
The Baby Guardian B9000 - a prototype by Sarah Babski and Deniz Ozkaynak

# Project Summary
Our container is a tool for a busy and cautious parent to attach to their baby carriage. Using an Arduino Uno and various sensors, we monitor and display important safety metrics for both the child and parent. For the safety of the baby, temperature, wind chill, and UV exposure of the carriage will be monitored. For the safety of the parent - and by extension the baby - heart rate and the carriage's speed will be monitored. It attaches on the handle of the carriage and shows the information on an LCD screen. In addition, there is a phone mount and a small slot to hold the parentâ€™s other necessities.
